This project focuses on analyzing possible factors of sleep disorder to gain insights and create predictive model on disorder possibility.

Steps Involved:
1. Data Understanding:
    Firstly, the raw data is examined to identify key attributes, such as gender, occupation, sleep duration, stress level, etc. The structure, types of data, and potential relationships between attributes is also assessed to understand the scope of analysis.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
    There are no missing records in the dataset. However, there are several column that are being encoded into numerical data, like gender, bmi category, and sleep disorder. Irrelevant column is also removed with the help of insight from heatmap and business understanding.

3. Data Analysis & Visualization:
    Statistical methods and visualization tools is used to analyze patterns and trends over time. The visualization, such as boxplot, histogram, pie chart, and heatmap, is displayed to highlight key insights.

4. Model Selection, Training, and Evaluation:
    The machine learning model used is Random Forest with the accuracy of 92.21%.

Insight gathered :
- The BMI and age shows high corelation with the sleep disorder
- Statistic shows that female is more likely to have sleep disorder
